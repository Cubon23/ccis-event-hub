                    The <strong>CCIS Event Board</strong> is a centralized digital platform designed to keep
                    students, faculty, and staff of the College of Computer and Information Sciences (CCIS)
                    informed about upcoming events, announcements, and academic or extracurricular activities.
                    It serves as a reliable hub where important information can be accessed easily and in real time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The system promotes <strong>transparency and effective communication</strong> by ensuring
                    that all official CCIS events and announcements are published in one accessible location.
                    This minimizes missed updates, reduces confusion, and eliminates reliance on informal
                    communication channels such as word-of-mouth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Beyond announcements, the CCIS Event Board encourages
                    <strong>student engagement and participation</strong> by showcasing seminars, workshops,
                    competitions, meetings, and other CCIS-related activities.
